"City Cycle Race","Government / Public sector","This shiny app allows to compare how fast people cycle in your city. This app uses data from strava to compare the cyclists in two cities. How is this possible? Strava is a sports tracking app. Basically whenever people cycle they can track themselves using GPS. Afterwards they will know how fast they went on their track. This is not comparable. Though, strava build in a feature called segments. These segments are tracks of any length all around the world. On each of these segments strava the users can have a virtual race. The time they needed for the segment is stored on a leaderboard. The fastest cyclist is the King of the Mountain on this segment. The data is available for everybody having a strava account via the strava API. This package ( + app) includes the data and allows to crawl it by certain features","https://sebastianwolf.shinyapps.io/stravachaserapp/","Sebastian Wolf","Shiny App Creators","0","0","","2021-04-22","https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/city-cycle.html"
"ScotPHO Profiles Tool","Government / Public sector","An interactive local area health and wellbeing profiling tool for Scotland. The app provides users with an assortment of custom interactive visualisations, allowing exploration of temporal and geographical comparisons across a range of indicators of health and wider determinants of health. This app is one of the runners up of the 2019 Shiny Contest. The app was created to help people living and working in Scotland explore how geographical areas have changed over time or how they compare to other areas, across a range of indicators of health and wider determinants of health. The app is pretty complicated, but no more than it has to be with such a sprawling dataset behind it. Each part of the app has a carefully curated set of options that expose lots of power without being totally overwhelming. The context-sensitive Definition button and pervasive Download data/Save chart options are nice touches as well.","https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/","Vicky Elliott, Jaime Villacampa, Zsanett Bahor","Shiny app creators","0","0","","2021-05-12","https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/scotpho-profiles.html"
